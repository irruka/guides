## Open questions

1. How to organize the output:
- HTML - one topic per screen or all steps in one HTML topic (but if we use too many photos, users may have to scroll too much)
- Try to balance photos and diagrams (check that they don't get repetative or too many)
2. Use the slot IDs from the board in the instruction steps to identify where to insert components, for example SW1 for the reset button instead of "right side of the PCB".
3. What level of detail to use for the description of each component (what does it do?).
4. Do we use one photo for all components in the bag or separate photos for each component?
5. In each procedure, add a step about which components should get pulled and which pushed. Also, mention which components should "lie tightly" on the surface of the board (some procedures have this step, but other don't).
6. Photos in procedures with build up of components; the component you assemble is circled and an arrow points to it.
7. Naming convention for md files (the github convention) - Title-of-topic.md
