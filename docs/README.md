##Open questions

1. How to organize the output:
- HTML - one topic per screen or all steps in one HTML topic (but if we use too many photos, users may have to scroll too much)
- try to balance photos and diagrams (check that they don't get repetative or too many)
2. Use the slot IDs from the board in the instruction steps to identify where to insert components, for example SW1 for the reset button instead of "right side of the PCB"
