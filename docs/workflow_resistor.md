## Resistor
**Orientation of the component: not relevant

1. Bend the leads of the resistor to 90 degrees.
2. Insert the leads of the resistor into the R1 holes on the PCB front side. 
3. Pull the leads down so that the resistor lies tightly on the PCB front side.

4. Bend the leads to 45 degrees in opposing directions to prevent the resistor from falling off the PCB.
5. Turn the PCB on its backside.
6. Solder the leads of the resistor to the PCB backside. 
7. Cut the leads to length.
You have added the resistor to the PCB.
