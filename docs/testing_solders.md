# Testing Your Solders
<!-- terminology-edit: testing vs. checking -->

Before you solder the battery socket onto your Tinosaur board, make sure you have correctly connected the other components to the PCB (printed circuit board).
<!-- structure-edit: remove battery reference from text to make the topic more general-->

Check your board for the following defects:
###### Short Circuits:
* **Description:**
	Two or more solders are joined together. Two or more leads touching can also cause a short ciruit.
*  **Resolution:**
	Use a soldering iron to reheat the space between the two joints. Drag tweezers or a sharp object between the solders to separate the joints.
    
###### Cold Joints:
* **Description:**
	Joints that have too little or too much solder.
* **Resolution:**
	* When the there is not enough solder, use a soldering iron to reheat the joint and to add more soldering wire.
	* When there is too much solder, use a soldering iron to heat the joint and a desoldering vacuum pump to remove the defective solder. Then, you can resolder the joint.
