#Testing Your Solders

Before you solder the battery socket onto your Tinosaur board, make sure you have correctly connected the other components to the PCB (printed circuit board).

Check your board for the following defects:
######Short Circuits:
* **Description:**
	Two or more solders are joined together. Two or more leads touching can also cause a short ciruit.
*  **Resolution:**
	Use a soldering iron to reheat the space between the two joints. Drag tweezers or a sharp object between the solders to separate the joints.
    
######Cold Joints:
* **Description:**
	Joints that have too little or too much solder.
* **Resolution:**
	* When the there is not enough solder, use a soldering iron to reheat the joint and to add more soldering wire.
	* When there is too much solder, use a soldering iron to heat the joint and a desoldering vacuum pump to remove the defective solder. Then, you can resolder the joint.
