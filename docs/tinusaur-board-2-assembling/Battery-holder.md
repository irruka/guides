<!-- image-edit: annotate, callouts where needed to explain which is which -->
<!-- image-add: before soldering, separate images of the battery holder and the board, so that it is clear where is the plus and the minus-->
Check the spring of the battery holder and make sure it fits in the holder properly.

To mount the battery holder:

1. Flip the PCB upside down.
2. Sand the solders to make them equal in h–µight.
<!-- image-add: sanding specifics -->
3. Place the battery holder.
4. Solder the leads on the front side of the PCB. Put more solder wire than usual.


**Caution**: This solder is the most challenging one. You must be very careful to not touch the elecrolytic capacitor with the soldering iron.
