# List of components

<!-- add-content: short description for each component-->

## Main Board Bag

1. Tinusaur printed circuit board (PCB)

A board made of non-conductive material on which you mount and solder the components to connect them together, so that they form a working circuit. The Tinusaur PCB is designed to do specific jobs. The design of the PCB is described in a schema that you can use to identify where to mount each component. Look for the schema card in your Tinusaur box.

2. Socket, DIP-8

A socket is a placeholder for the microcontroller (MCU) that connects the MCU to the board. Because the MCU is sensitive to heat and could get damaged during smoldering, the socket makes it easy to plug the MCU in and out. DIP stands for "Dual Inline Package", which is an integrated circuit package with two rows of pins. 8 is the number of the pins.

3. MCU, ATtiny85

"Atmel AVR ATtiny85" is the "family name" of the microcontroller (MCU) that you connect to the Tinusaur PCB and program to do specific tasks. Think of it as the brain of the operation that can get a light-emitting diode (LED) to turn on and off.

## USB Programmer

Use the USB 2.0 programmer to connect the Tinusaur PCB to a PC or a Mac for testing and programming the main board.
