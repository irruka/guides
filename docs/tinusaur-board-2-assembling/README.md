Tinusaur Board 2 - Assembling Guide

# Structure of the guide

## Placeholders for images in each file

### Battery-holder.md
Orientation images:
- image-edit: Battery.holder.jpg - save as .png; annotate, call-outs where needed to explain which is which for the correct orientation
- image-add: before soldering, separate images of the battery holder and the board, so that it is clear where the plus and the minus are

- step 2: image-add: sanding specifics

### Notes for all files:
- acronyms-consider: all acronyms must be explained at the first place they appear
- structure-consider: see where the orientation/positioning tips appear on the required places, i.e. at the beginning of every procedure
