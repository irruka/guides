## Electrolytic Capacitor
**Orientation of the component: is relevant
<!-- unclear-reword: orientation -->
1. Insert the leads of the electrolytic capacitor into C1 plus and minus holes on PCB front side.
**Note:** The negative lead of the electrolytic capacitor is marked with a white line on the cylinder, and is the shorter of the two pins of the electrolytic capacitor.

3. Pull the leads down so that the electrolytic capacitor lies tightly on the PCB front side. 
4. Bend the leads to 45 degrees in opposing direction to prevent the resistor from falling off the PCB.
<!-- terminology-edit: simplify sentence, 45 degrees is a bit difficult for a younnger audience -->
5. Turn the PCB on its backside.
6. Solder the leads of the electrolytic capacitor (component) to the PCB backside. 
7. Cut the leads to length.
You have added the electrolytic capacitor to the PCB.
