<!-- image-edit: orientation is wrong -->
2. (Optional) Plug the ISP cable to the male shrouded header to avoid shifting of the pins during soldering.
<!-- content-add: pins shift because plastic parts melt -->
3. Turn the PCB on its backside.
4. Solder the pins of the header to the PCB backside. 

You have added the male shrouded header to the PCB.
