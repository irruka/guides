# What is Tinusaur 

## With the Tinusaur kit you can assemble your own pocket-size Tinusaur microcontroller and make your first steps in computer hardware engineering.

If you are a _high school_ or _university student_, the Tinusaur project can be your very first hardware assembly work.

If you are a _teacher_, the Tinusaur project will help you lead action-packed classes in hardware studies and assembly.

If you _run a hobby club_, the Tinusaur project will help you immerse your club members in the complex matter of microcontrollers, and create Internet of things.

The Tinusaur kit consists of electronic components that you assemble and solder to create a working microcontroller board. After the board has been assembled, you can use Tinusaur to run computer programs or, even more excitingly, _write and run_ your own microcontroller programs.
