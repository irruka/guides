To insert the Reset button on the PCB:

1. Insert the Reset button on the back side of the PCB. Make sure the reset button is facing outside the PCB.
<!-- unclear-reword: back vs. bottom of board, clarify directions and add to drawings -->
<!-- unclear-reword: all openings on the board are labeled, use board labels to refer to openings in procedures -->
**Note**: If the lower part of the leads is too thick and cannot go through the PCB holes, cut it.
<!-- misplaced-moveup: this is a prerequisite, not a note -->
<!-- content-add: leads must be bent before soldering -->
2. Solder the Reset button on the front side of the PC.
