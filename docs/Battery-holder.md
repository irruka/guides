To mount the battery holder:

1. Flip the PCB upside down.
2. Sand the solders to make them with equal h–µight.
3. Check the spring of the battery holder and make sure it fits in the holder properly.
4. Place the battery holder.
5. Solder the leads on the front side of the PCB and put more solder wire than usual.


**Caution**: This solder is the most challenging one. You must be very careful to not touch the elecrolytic capacitor with the soldering iron.
